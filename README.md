DemulShooter is a software interfering with (mostly) emulators to allow users to play railshooter games with up to 4 lightguns or HID devices (Joystick, analog controllers...).
Except for some emulators (MAME, supermodel), most of them do not support RawInput protocol and thus dual player mode with mouse-alike devices.
It was greatly inspired by the TroubleShooter 2 Software, which unfortunatelly did not support Demul and can be troublesome for users having swappable USB devices.

DemulShooter also provides outputs signal to enable LEDs and Force Feedback on lightgun/cabinets.
